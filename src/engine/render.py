"""Render the project's content docs from templates + filled interview slots.

Templates use ``${slot_name}`` placeholders (``string.Template``). A slot the
interview has filled substitutes in; an unfilled slot is left as ``${slot_name}``
and reported — so a half-onboarded project's gaps stay visible rather than going
silently blank. Templates ship embedded in the bootstrap (the generated
``_TEMPLATES`` dict) and, in the source/pip layouts, under
``engine/templates/`` (inside the package so a wheel ships them).

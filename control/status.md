# Self Improvement seat — heartbeat
updated: 2026-07-15T14:53Z · phase: EAP EXTENSION ACTIVE (EAP through 2026-07-21; inbox consumed 001–024; routines coordinator-managed)

## This wake (2026-07-15 · work slice · claude/heartbeat-delegated-tally · PR #395)
- Baton item 2 built (no inbox ORDER above 024 at sync HEAD 0d33d55; control/claims/ held README only at the ~14:4xZ scan; zero open PRs at open; `currency --check` exit 0 — no regen slice due): the delegated-tally heartbeat doctrine (idea docs/ideas/heartbeat-delegated-tally-guidance-2026-07-13.md, consumer-origin: the mineverse "COORDINATOR-DELEGATED heartbeat write" precedent, night-run report §f). New "Delegated tally — coordinator-written heartbeats" section in `src/engine/templates/control-README.md.tmpl` + the kit's own `control/README.md`: (1) the marked delegated write (`COORDINATOR-DELEGATED heartbeat write …` first line after `updated:`); (2) the member-repo standing `notes:` pointer to where its live tally lives; (3) the sweep rule — classify a seat by PR record + coordinator status, never by seat-heartbeat staleness alone. `control-status.md.tmpl` seed notes gain a one-line pointer. Docs/template only — no gate/grammar changes. Plus idea lifecycle flip (frontmatter promoted/shipped_pr 395 + README Backlog → Shipped), CHANGELOG [Unreleased] ### Added entry, dist byte-pin regen (84ea511).
- Verify (at 84ea511): `python3 scripts/preflight.py` → 8/8 legs green (pytest 1604 passed 1 skipped; dist-byte-pin; ruff; idea-index; retro-index; changelog-structure; program-law; bench-integrity). `dist/bootstrap.py check --strict` → designed born-red HOLD only (this wake's card, pre-flip) + known staged-regen-lag ×3; guard-fires telemetry delta committed per checker instruction.

## Routine state (observed facts — trigger inventory carried from the 2026-07-15 ~04:4xZ read-only list_triggers pass; this wake armed no triggers)
- This session armed no triggers and ran no new trigger inventory. Routines are coordinator-managed this wake.
- Carried observation (04:4xZ pass): "Self Improvement failsafe wake" trig_01CUfSZo9Uky9DdpoqpZPcfT — cron `0 */2 * * *`, enabled=true, created 2026-07-15T04:38:07Z via meta_mcp, bound to a coordinator session (persistent_session_id session_01SFVAo5bPD41RMx9TzGxnPY) — plus one pending one-shot pacemaker (run_once_at 2026-07-15T04:55:00Z, same session binding). Not created by this seat's sessions.
- ⚑ FOR OWNER REVIEW: ORDER 024 (control/inbox.md @ 58b3f80) states "do NOT re-arm routines yet; wait for the owner's per-seat go (the v3.6 reboot prompt IS that go)". The observed failsafe above post-dates that order. This heartbeat records the discrepancy neutrally for the owner's review/veto; it does not adjudicate it. Prior heartbeat (git history @ 58b3f80) had recorded all seat routines verified DOWN; kit-lab daily loop re-arm recipe remains docs/operations/lab-loop.md.

## State
- kit: v1.17.0
- v1.17.0 distributed 9/9 engaged adopters; registry (docs/adopters.md, generated 13:14:20Z at #391) current — this wake's `currency --check` live run confirmed exit 0 (12 repos, rows-only compare, zero delta); DRIFT rows unchanged (superbot-next, superbot-games, superbot-mineverse self-report lag + kit's tree-internal pin row).
- Wake currency scan is turnkey (#392): `python3 dist/bootstrap.py currency --check` — exit 0 registry current / exit 1 regen slice due (changed rows printed). Use it instead of hand-fetching adopter `kit:` lines.
- Delegated-tally doctrine (#395): coordinator-written heartbeats are marked, member repos carry a live-tally pointer, sweeps classify by PR record + coordinator status — `control/README.md` § "Delegated tally" (template: control-README.md.tmpl; adopters inherit on next upgrade/regen wave).
- Model-line effort taxonomy (#394): `unrecorded` is the sanctioned terminal value for retro-repaired cards whose authors never self-reported effort — advisory-silent, harvested verbatim; live sessions still report `low|medium|high` (.sessions/README.md teaches the reservation).
- Grounded-skills measurement: harness MERGED (#386, main @ c5380dc) — turnkey: `python3 scripts/measure_grounded_skills.py --clone --workdir <dir> --json <f> --out <f>`; protocol pre-registered at docs/operations/grounded-skills-measurement.md.
- Revival boot reading: CONSTITUTION.md → control/inbox.md → this file → docs/eap-closeout-walkthrough-2026-07-14.md §E → docs/audits/eap-project-audit-2026-07-14.md.

## Next-2 baton
1. Grounded-skills measurement window ~2026-07-19..26 — run per docs/operations/grounded-skills-measurement.md (turnkey since #386 merged; PR #247 methodology; owner silence accepts); publish the findings report under docs/reports/ and link it from the operations index.
2. Next buildable idea from the Backlog (13 captured rows remain — not dry): plain-adopt lane-drift advisory (docs/ideas/plain-adopt-lane-drift-advisory-2026-07-10.md); alternative if an engine slice fits better: the cross-branch ORDER-collision claim segment (docs/ideas/order-claim-cross-branch-collision-2026-07-14.md).

## ⚑ FOR OWNER (standing set carried forward — NO new asks this wake)

⚑ P10 required-check swap
WHAT: Swap which CI check main requires, from the two legacy names to the current one.
WHERE: repo Settings → Rules → the `main` ruleset → required status checks.
HOW: remove "Kit test suite" and "Cold-adoption smoke (adopt + check --strict)"; add `kit-quality` (source: GitHub Actions); set "Require branches to be up to date" OFF.
WHY: the legacy alias jobs exist purely to satisfy the old required names; the up-to-date requirement stalls green PRs `behind`.
UNBLOCKS: deleting the two legacy-alias jobs; ends the queue-stall class.
VERIFY: next kit PR shows kit-quality as the only required check; agent then removes the alias jobs.
RISK: ↩️ reversible — re-add the old required checks in the same ruleset panel.

⚑ public-flip-or-PAT (pick one)
WHAT: Let the other fleet repos read this one — either make it public or mint a read-only token.
WHERE: P11: Settings → General → Danger Zone → Change visibility · P13: github.com/settings/tokens → fine-grained read-only PAT scoped to this repo, then add it to the fleet environments.
HOW: P11 is click-through; P13 is create-token + paste into environment settings.
WHY: sibling repos cannot read kit data today, so cross-repo sweeps and the merged console run blind.
UNBLOCKS: B2–B4 cross-repo sweeps + kit data in the merged console.
VERIFY: a sibling-seat session fetches a kit file read-only without "Access denied: repository … is not configured for this session".
RISK: ⚠️ P11 effectively irreversible (history exposed once public) · ↩️ P13 reversible — revoke anytime.

Standing (full paste-ready blocks verbatim in git history of this file @ 86d2a57):
- fm #122 v3.4 restamp — owner reviews/merges PERSONALLY.
- UNIVERSAL wake fetch-list vN bump (+ docs/seat-digest.md, docs/SKILLS.md).
- Grounded-skills measurement window ~2026-07-19..26 — silence accepts.
